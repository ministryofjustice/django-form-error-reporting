Django Form Error Reporting
===========================

**DEPRECATED**: We have decided to not update this package to support GA4 and this is
no longer maintained.

A form mixin that reports form errors as events to Google Analytics.

NB: Only Universal Analytics is supported, which is now deprecated!

Usage
-----

Install using ``pip install django-form-error-reporting``.

See examples in tests/forms.py

.. code-block:: python

    class ReportedForm(GAErrorReportingMixin, Form):
        ga_tracking_id = 'UA-12345678-0'

        ...

To work on changes to this library, itâ€™s recommended to install it in editable mode into a virtual environment,
i.e. ``pip install --editable .``

Use ``python -m tests`` to run all tests locally.
Alternatively, you can use ``tox`` if you have multiple python versions.

[Only for GitHub team members] Distribute a new version to `PyPI`_ by:

- updating the ``VERSION`` tuple in ``form_error_reporting.py``
- adding a note to the `History`_
- publishing a release on GitHub which triggers an upload to PyPI;
  alternatively, run ``python -m build; twine upload dist/*`` locally
